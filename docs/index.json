I am particularly interested in all things related to vasculature.\nComplexity theory involves the study of systems whose components interact non-linearly and at many different scales. Nearly all physiological systems can be conceptualized through a complex systems framework. Interactions between trillions of heterogeneous signaling molecules and cells form sophisticated pathways and feedback loops, allowing humans to conquer incredible physical and intellectual feats; from flying to the moon or summiting the tallest mountain on earth to the surprisingly intricate tasks of breathing, blinking, thinking, and even simply being. These complex physiological processes are dynamic - changing over time - and sometimes becoming dysfunctional. In some sense, this dysfunctionality could be used to explain every death or disease in history. In this framework, the goal of medicine is to identify where the system has become dysfunctional and fix the problem. Of course, this is nothing close to a trivial question, and some types of dysfunction are more accessible to identify and repair than others. A central challenge is that in the medical realm, clinically accessible data are never a direct measurement of these fundamental driving processes. Instead, they reflect the collective dynamics of these many processes riddled with noise and non-stationarity effects. Therefore, my research is focused on how we can use tools from complex systems theory to map this observable behavior to information about the function (or dysfunction) of the many physiologic processes forming that behavior and identifying the pathologies or functionality associated with those fundamental physiologic processes.\n","permalink":"https://jenniferkbriggs.github.io/projects/researchoverview/","summary":"My research interests involve using computational methods from dynamical systems theory, complexity science, and machine learning to explain new physiological phenomena, advance biomedicine, and provide predictive capabilities that can change human health through better clinical decision-making.

The pressure reactivity index is an important, prevalent metric used to estimate the state of a patient\u0026rsquo;s cerebral autoregulation and guide clinical decision-making. However, the pressure reactivity index is highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices and intrapatient variability. In this manuscript, we develop a new personalized pressure reactivity index methodology (pPRx) that increases robustness and reduces the noise of the pressure reactivity index calculation. Using data from traumatic brain injury patients and simulated data, we first show that pressure reactivity index sensitivity to hyperparameters and interpatient variability is large enough to influence clinical interpretation of cerebral autoregulatory function. We identify that patient heart rate is closely related to errors in the pressure reactivity index, which has vital implications for extending the use of PRx to patients with different regular heart rates, such as pediatric populations. We then remove this heart rate specific sensitivity in the pPRx methodology by adjusting for patient heart rate at resolutions of single heartbeats. Implementing the pPRx methodology decreases error, noise, and sensitivity, and allows the pressure reactivity index to be more robust to variability across patient populations. We also leverage our data and analysis to identify ideal averaging windows in the standard method.\n-Read our preprint here\n","permalink":"https://jenniferkbriggs.github.io/projects/prxsensitivity/","summary":"Neurocritical care patients may benefit from personalized treatment based on their cerebral autoregulatory function.

Therefore, we are constructing a literature review of cerebral autoregulation metrics and physiologic mechanisms from a timescales perspective.\nSee our preprint below. This review is being significantly reorganized. We appreciate any constructive feedback.\nRead our paper here!\nAdequate brain perfusion is required for proper brain function and life. Maintaining optimal brain perfusion to avoid secondary brain injury is one of the main concerns of neurocritical care. Cerebral autoregulation is responsible for maintaining optimal brain perfusion despite pressure derangements. Knowledge of cerebral autoregulatory function should be a key factor in clinical decision-making, yet it is often insufficiently and incorrectly applied. Multiple physiologic mechanisms impact cerebral autoregulation, each of which operate on potentially different and incompletely understood timescales confounding conclusions drawn from observations. Because of such complexities, clinical conceptualization of cerebral autoregulation has been distilled into practical indices defined by multimodal neuromonitoring, which removes mechanistic information and limits decision options. The next step towards cerebral autoregulatory-informed clinical decision-making is to quantify cerebral autoregulation mechanistically, which requires decomposing cerebral autoregulation into its fundamental processes and partitioning those processes into the timescales at which each operates. In this review, we scrutinize biologically, clinically, and computationally focused literature to build a timescales-based framework around cerebral autoregulation. We conclude that the myogenic mechanism acts on timescales faster than one second, the endothelial mechanism acts in one to two minutes, the metabolic mechanism will act on different timescales depending on the circumstance but will not be reflected in dynamic CA testing due to timescale constraints, and the neurologic mechanism acts within two seconds. These timescales have never been synthesized in the literature and lay the foundation for a new framework in which to view and test cerebral autoregulatory function. This new framework will allow us to quantify mechanistic interactions and directly infer which mechanism(s) are functioning based only on current monitoring equipment, paving the way for a new frontier in cerebral autoregulatory-informed clinical decision-making.\n","permalink":"https://jenniferkbriggs.github.io/projects/catimescales/","summary":"We are interested in analyzing cerebral autoregulation from a dyanmical systems perspective.

The diversity of immune types in a population is known to influence pathogen evolution and epidemic dynamics: populations with many immune types are often more robust to epidemics, since a pathogen cannot widely circulate until it evolves the ability to evade many of the established immune types. However, little is known about the effect of the spatial distribution of these immune types on the evolution and transmission of an infectious disease. In this project, we use both a mean-field mathematical model and an agent-based model to understand how “clumpiness” in the spatial distribution of immune types influences the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of an infectious disease. Clumpier spatial distributions (higher values of p in Figure 1) contain larger patches of identical immune types and enable less contact between individuals with different immune types. In both of our models we consider a two-dimensional grid with each cell assigned to one of several immune types (Figure 1). A wild-type contagion (which is able to infect only one immune type) is randomly seeded at one cell. We model disease spread between neighbors using an SIR framework, and we model pathogen evolution by allowing for rare, random mutations which generate disease variants that are able to evade one or more of the established immune types. So far, we have found that more clumpy immune type distributions generally result in more cumulative infections and longer epidemics. While the current model focuses on the spatial distribution of vaccines, we anticipate that our analysis will be relevant to many systems which obey similar rules, such as agricultural systems, the spread of beliefs, and zoonosis in multi-host ecosystems.\nCollaborators:\nJennifer Briggs1, Gates Dupont2, Ian Harryman3, Haoyuan Luo4, Maike Morrison3, David O’Gara5, Simon Rella6 1 University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, 2 Princeton University, 3 Stanford University, 4 University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, 5 Washington University in St. Louis, 6 Institute of Science and Technology Austria\nCorresponding author: Maike Morrison, maikem@stanford.edu\n","permalink":"https://jenniferkbriggs.github.io/projects/infectivity/","summary":"Spatial patterns of immunity across a population are structured both by natural processes, such as evolutionary history and past epidemics, and by artificial processes, such as vaccination.
