[{"content":"My research interests are in using computational methods from complexity science and systems biology to explain new physiological phenomena, advance biomedicine, and provide predictive capabilities that can change human heath through better clinical decision making. Complexity theory is the study of systems whose components interact non-linearly and at many different scales. Nearly all physiological systems can be conceptualized through a complex systems framework. Interactions between trillions of heterogeneous signaling molecules and cells form sophisticated pathways and feedback loops, allowing humans to conquer incredible physical and intellectual feats; from flying to the moon or summiting the tallest mountain on earth to the surprisingly intricate tasks of breathing, blinking, thinking, and even simply being. These complex physiological processes are dynamic - changing overtime - and sometimes becoming dysfunctional. In some sense, this dysfunctionality could be used to explain every death or disease in history. The entire goal of medicine, then, is to identify where the system has become dysfunctional and fix the problem. Of course, this is nothing close to a trivial question and some types of dysfunction are easier to identify and fix than others. A central challenge is that in the medical realm, clinically accessible data are never a direct measurement of these fundamental driving processes. Instead, they are a reflection of the collective dynamics of these many processes riddled with noise and non-stationarity effects. Therefore, my research is focused on how we can use tools from complex systems theory to map this observable behavior to information about the function (or dysfunction) of the many physiologic processes forming that behavior and identifying the pathologies or functionality associated with those fundamental physiologic process. In my thesis, I study two physiological systems; the vascular system and the endocrine system, using a complex systems framework with the aim of aiding in clinical decision making and advancing biomedicine.\n","permalink":"localhost/projects/researchoverview/","summary":"My research interests are in using computational methods from complexity science and systems biology to explain new physiological phenomena, advance biomedicine, and provide predictive capabilities that can change human heath through better clinical decision making.

At best, when applied for clinical decision support, these models provide an estimate of blood flow and generalized state of the vasculature. In the worst case, our lab has shown that these models predict blood flow to be out of phase of the data, possibly causing hyper- or hypo- perfusion and damage to the patient if these models are used in clinical decision support. We have a large, mutli-center data set of neurological ICU patients to execute this aim.\nWe will develop a novel model of cerebral hemodynamics informed by the mechanisms driving cerebral autoregualtion. Previous models perform well when tracking cerebral hemodynamics however they are highly non-identifiable or physiologically interpretable.\nIn the new model, there are three parameters representing the state of each autoregualtion mechanism. We will build out a data assimilation technique which infers the state of each mechanism and how it changes over time. This state will eventually be used for clinical decision support.\nThere is no gold standard on which to test the state of autoregulatory mechanisms against. Further, there is no ethical way to directly test the state of autoregulatory mechanisms in patients, which is the motivation for this model. However, reaction to medication as well as blood test can give us an idea of the function of different cerebral autoreuglatory mechanisms. Therefore, we will develop a novel validation pipeline Which uses electronic health record data to evaluate the accuracy of our model prediction.\n","permalink":"localhost/projects/camodel/","summary":"Most current models of the cerebral hemodynamic system infer the bulk effect of vascular autoregulation but do not infer cerebral autoregulation mechanistically.

A goal in neurocritical care is to optimize brain perfusion. Cerebral Autoregulation (CA) is an intrinsic property of healthy vasculature which maintains optimal perfusion over large pressure gradients. To ensure proper brain perfusion, clinical guidelines recommend targetting ABP to where CA is optimized. Pressure Reactivity Index (PRx) is a common proxy for CA. PRx is estimated by taking the correlation coefficient between a given number of averaged ICP and ABP samples. Averaging window size and number of samples taken for correlation are therefore hyperparameters in the PRx calculation. However, little work has been done to understand the choice of hyperparameters used for PRx calculation is controversial. Due to the data\u0026rsquo;s invasive nature, clinically accessible cerebral autoregulation metrics are not validatible in the typical sense. In this project, we calculate PRx for many different combinations of averaging and correlation windows in patient and synthetic data to quantify the sensitivity of PRx to hyperparameters and explore patient specific methodology\n","permalink":"localhost/projects/prxsensitivity/","summary":"Neurovascular injuries are a leading cause of death.

This pulsatility is disrupted in diabetes. Studying synchronization of calcium oscillations, previous work has suggested that highly synchronized cells have disproportionate influence over the islet and are targeted in diabetes. In this paper, we use network theory to disprove the common assumption that synchronization directly indicates structure connectivity and show that other factors must be taken into account when utilizing network theory to study network breakdown.\nRead our paper here!\n","permalink":"localhost/projects/ilset_network/","summary":"Highly heterogeneous beta-cells within the islet are electrically coupled to synchronize their oscillations and secrete insulin in a pulsatile fashion.

The diversity of immune types in a population is known to influence pathogen evolution and epidemic dynamics: populations with many immune types are often more robust to epidemics, since a pathogen cannot widely circulate until it evolves the ability to evade many of the established immune types. However, little is known about the effect of the spatial distribution of these immune types on the evolution and transmission of an infectious disease. In this project, we use both a mean-field mathematical model and an agent-based model to understand how “clumpiness” in the spatial distribution of immune types influences the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of an infectious disease. Clumpier spatial distributions (higher values of p in Figure 1) contain larger patches of identical immune types and enable less contact between individuals with different immune types. In both of our models we consider a two-dimensional grid with each cell assigned to one of several immune types (Figure 1). A wild-type contagion (which is able to infect only one immune type) is randomly seeded at one cell. We model disease spread between neighbors using an SIR framework, and we model pathogen evolution by allowing for rare, random mutations which generate disease variants that are able to evade one or more of the established immune types. So far, we have found that more clumpy immune type distributions generally result in more cumulative infections and longer epidemics. While the current model focuses on the spatial distribution of vaccines, we anticipate that our analysis will be relevant to many systems which obey similar rules, such as agricultural systems, the spread of beliefs, and zoonosis in multi-host ecosystems.\nCollaborators:\nJennifer Briggs1, Gates Dupont2, Ian Harryman3, Haoyuan Luo4, Maike Morrison3, David O’Gara5, Simon Rella6 1 University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, 2 Princeton University, 3 Stanford University, 4 University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, 5 Washington University in St. Louis, 6 Institute of Science and Technology Austria\nCorresponding author: Maike Morrison, maikem@stanford.edu\n","permalink":"localhost/projects/infectivity/","summary":"Spatial patterns of immunity across a population are structured both by natural processes, such as evolutionary history and past epidemics, and by artificial processes, such as vaccination.
