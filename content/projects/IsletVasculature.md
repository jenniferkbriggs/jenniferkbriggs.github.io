Blood flow regulation throughout the islet is an understudied yet highly important topic for blood hormone regulation. Blood flow regulation has been shown to be impaired at both the capillary and arteriole level. We use experimental results from both mouse and human islets to identify the thresholds for which capillary and arteriole regulation become more essential in defining islet blood flow.
