Thanks for visiting my site! 

My research interests involve using computational methods from dynamical systems theory, complexity science, and machine learning to infer new physiological phenomena, advance biomedicine, and provide predictive capabilities that can change human health through better clinical decision-making. Please see my CV for full list of publications and conferences.
