We have derived a novel model of cerebral hemodynamics that includes the action of mechanisms driving cerebral vascular tone regulation. We embedd this model into a data assimilation and neural ODE framework to estimate personalized hemodynamical models. Using these personalized models, we can forecast cerebral blood flow and estimate functionality of physiology underlying vascular regulation.
